# NODE PROJECT CREATOR
Start a new Node.JS project from scratch can be a tedious task, 
specially when things like Babel, ESLint and Prettier, 
are required to the project, 
due the bunch of stuff we have to set up until start to code. 
This project intents to overcome these problems, 
offering a GUI where you put the name of the new project, 
choose what packages are required to it _(e.g., Babel, Sequelize, Prettier)_, 
and, after you enjoy a cup of coffee, your new project will be ready for you.

### For now, this tool can install:
- Babel
- ESLint and Prettier
    - AirBnB Style Guide

    - PostgreSQL
    - MYSQL
    - Maria DB
